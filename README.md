## Description
This project utilizes Node.js, the standard Node library fs, and the Node Package Module Inquirer (Version 8.2.4). This program presents the user with a series of terminal prompts, allowing them to easily create a professional README file for a development project. The program automatically takes this input and creates a markdown file with it.

## Installation
As Node is a server-side runtime environment, you will of course need to have Node.js installed on your local system. You will also need the project itself on your local system. Once this is done,  open a terminal window and navigate to the project's parent folder. The command 'npm install' will install the necessary node modules to run the program. To initiate the program, simply enter 'node index.js' in the command line.
## Usage
Once the program begins, you will be presented with a series of prompts in your command line. Simply type in your desired input in each field or make a selection from provided choices. If you do not want to add content to a particular section, simply leave blank or write 'N/A.' Once all prompts are completed, the program will notify you in the command line once your new README file is ready to view. This file can be found in the "output" folder. Before re-running the program, make sure you move that file to another folder if you want to keep it, otherwise it will be overwritten.
